The correct way to target only the `.container` element on hover is to be more specific in the selector:

```css
.container:hover {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

By placing the `:hover` pseudo-class directly after the `.container` class selector, we ensure that the style is only applied to the container itself when it is hovered, preventing unintended styling of its children.
