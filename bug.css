The following CSS rule unintentionally targets elements within the `.container` class that also have the `:hover` pseudo-class applied:

```css
.container :hover {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

This rule will also style any other elements within the `.container` that are hovered, not just the `.container` element itself.  This behavior can be unexpected and lead to styling issues.
